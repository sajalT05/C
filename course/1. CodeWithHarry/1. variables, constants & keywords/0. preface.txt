// variables:
    1. containers that stores values.
    2. va can be changed.

// Rules for naming variables:
    1. first characters must;
        a. (a,b,...,z) characters
        b. (_) undescore
    2. not allowed:
        a. (,) comma
        b. ( ) blank
        c. (!,@,#,$,%,...) special symbols
    3. variables names are case sensitive.
    4. meaningful names are only allowed. 

// constants:
    1. entity whose value doesn't changes.
    2. types:
        a. (1,5,-8,-79) integer constants.
        b. (-464.23,6546.13) real constants, floats.
        c. ('f','$',...) character constants
            --> must be enclosed within inverted commas.

// keywords:
    1. meaning already defined in the compiler.
    2. 32 keywords.

    1. address of the operator
