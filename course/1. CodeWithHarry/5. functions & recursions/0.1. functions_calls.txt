// type of functions calls:
    based on the way we pass arguments to the funtions.
    1. call by value: sending values of arguments.
    2. call by reference: sending address of arguments.

// call by value functions:
    --> example
    function sum(a,b)
    // sum is a function( )
    // values are passed as arguments when funciton is called 
    int c = sum(5,6)

// call by reference funciton:
    1. address of variable is passed as argument.
    2. can modify value of a variable un calling function using (*) and (&).
    --> example
    function sum()
